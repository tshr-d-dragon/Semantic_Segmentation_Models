### Implementation:
1.  [DeepLabV3plus with EfficientNet as a backbone](https://github.com/tshr-d-dragon/Semantic_Segmentation_Models/blob/main/DeepLabV3plus_EfficientNet.py)
2.  [DeepLabV3plus_SqueezeExcitation with EfficientNet as a backbone](https://github.com/tshr-d-dragon/Semantic_Segmentation_Models/blob/main/DeepLabV3plusSE_EfficientNet.py)
3.  [DeepLabV3plus with ResNet as a backbone](https://github.com/tshr-d-dragon/Semantic_Segmentation_Models/blob/main/DeepLabV3plus_ResNet.py)
4.  [DeepLabV3plus with DenseNet as a backbone](https://github.com/tshr-d-dragon/Semantic_Segmentation_Models/blob/main/DeepLabV3plus_DenseNet.py)
5.  [DeepLabV3plus with SqueezeNet as a backbone](https://github.com/tshr-d-dragon/Semantic_Segmentation_Models/blob/main/DeepLabV3plus_SqueezeNet.py)
6.  [DeepLabV3plus with VGG16 as a backbone](https://github.com/tshr-d-dragon/Semantic_Segmentation_Models/blob/main/DeepLabV3plus_VGG16.py)



## 2.  Unet:

### Paper link: [U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597.pdf)

### Implementation:
1.  [Unet with MobileNetV2 as a backbone](https://github.com/tshr-d-dragon/Semantic_Segmentation_Models/blob/main/Unet_MobileNetV2.py)
2.  [Unet with EfficientNet as a backbone]() Coming Soon...
3.  [Unet with ResNet50 as a backbone]() Coming Soon...

**Note**: We can directly use [segmentation_models](https://segmentation-models.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package for Unet. It reduces the number of lines of code (Github: http://github.com/qubvel/segmentation_models).
